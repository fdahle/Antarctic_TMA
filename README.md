The aerial images are part of the "Antarctic Single Frame Records", a collection of aerial photographs made by the US Navy for mapping purposes in between 1946 and 2000. 
It includes black-and-white, natural color and color infrared images with a photographic scale ranging from 1:1,000 to 1:64,000.
