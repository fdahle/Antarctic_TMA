    """
    Extracts a fiducial mark from a given image, based on the specified key.
    This function applies a series of image processing steps (e.g., blurring, thresholding,
    canny edge detection) to extract lines and ultimately the fiducial marks at N, E, S, W positions
    from a specified subset of the input image.

    # Position of fid marks:
    # 3 7 2
    # 5   6
    # 1 8 4

    Args:
        image (np.ndarray): The input image from which the fiducial mark is to be extracted.
        key (str): A single character ('n', 'e', 's', 'w') indicating the direction (north, east,
            south, west) relative to which the fiducial mark is to be found.
        subset_bounds (Tuple[int, int, int, int]): A tuple containing the bounds
            (min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y) for the subset of the image to be processed.
        display (bool, optional): If True, the function will display the subset of the image used
            for fiducial mark extraction. Defaults to False.
    Returns:
        Optional[tuple[int, int]]: A tuple containing the x and y coordinates of the detected fiducial
            mark within the entire image. Returns None if no fiducial mark is detected.
    Raises:
        ValueError: If the provided `key` is not one of the expected values ('n', 'e', 's', 'w').
